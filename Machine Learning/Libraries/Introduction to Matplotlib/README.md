PROJECT TITLE

The project title should be "Introduction To Matplotlib".

GOAL

This helps readers in giving all the guidance that one needs to learn about matplotlib. Tutorial to matplotlib and how it's applied using sample code.

PURPOSE

Matplotlib is designed to be as usable as MATLAB, with the ability to use Python and the advantage of being free and open-source. Each pyplot function makes some change to a figure: e.g., creates a figure, creates a plotting area in a figure, plots some lines in a plotting area, decorates the plot with labels, etc.

DESCRIPTION
Each pyplot function makes some change to a figure: e.g., creates a figure, creates a plotting area in a figure, plots some lines in a plotting area, decorates the plot with labels, etc. In matplotlib.

WHAT I HAD DONE

The main intention of this repo is to educate beginners with all the concepts related to datascience so that they could feel confident to apply these things learnt in practical exposure.

WORKFLOW OF YOUR PROJECT FILES

In this repo, I have explained the following points in detail:-
1)What is Matplotlib
2)How to install this library
3)How to import this in your notebook
4)Multiple plots in a figure
5)Type of graphs

USAGE 
The main intention of this repo is to educate beginners with all the concepts related to datascience so that they could feel confident to apply these things learnt in practical exposure.

LIBRARIES USED

Matplotlib and Numpy

ADVANTAGES 1-Simple and easy to grasp for beginners. 2-Easier to use for people who have had prior experience with Matlab or other graph plotting tools. 3-It provides high-quality images and plots in various formats such as png, pdf, pgf, etc.
DISADVANTAGES 1-The library is very low-level, which means that one needs to write more code to get the visualisation as opposed to Tableau  2- The library is not the best for dealing with time series data since one needs to import all these helper classes for the year, month, week, day formatters, shared a user on a forum.

APPLICATIONS Interactive Applications Using Matplotlib,Open source alternative to MATLAB.

CONCLUSION Python is one of the most versatile and stable languages in over a decade. In this extremely stable programmatic setup, matplotlib library programs hold a great role in boosting the data-related aspects of this widely spread language.
