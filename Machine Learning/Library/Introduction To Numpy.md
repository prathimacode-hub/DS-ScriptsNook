**PROJECT TITLE**

The project title should be "Introduction To Numpy"


**GOAL**

This helps readers in giving all the guidance that one needs to learn about numpy. Tutorial to numpy and how it's applied using sample code.


**PURPOSE**

The main objective of numpy module is to handle or create single- or multi- dimensional arrays.
NumPy is a general-purpose array-processing package. 


**DESCRIPTION**

NumPy is an open-source numerical Python library. NumPy contains a multi-dimensional array and matrix data structures. It can be utilised to perform a number 
of mathematical operations on arrays such as trigonometric, statistical, and algebraic routines.NumPy arrays are faster and more compact than Python lists. An array consumes less memory and is convenient to use. 
NumPy uses much less memory to store data and it provides a mechanism of specifying the data types.

**WHAT I HAD DONE**

The main intention of this repo is to educate beginners with all the concepts related to datascience so that they could feel confident to apply these things learnt in practical exposure.

**USAGE**
The main intention of this repo is to educate beginners with all the concepts related to datascience so that they could feel confident to apply these things learnt in practical exposure.

**LIBRARIES USED**

Numpy (Pip install numpy)

**Why should we Use Numpy?**
NumPy arrays is that it takes less memory than the python list. Then, it is fast in terms of execution, and at the same time, it is convenient and easy to work with it.

**Why do we need Numpy?**
To make a logical and mathematical computation on array and matrices, numpy is needed. It performs these operations way too efficiently and faster than python lists.

**ADVANTAGES**
1- Numpy arrays take less space.
NumPy’s arrays are smaller in size than Python lists. A python list could take upto 20MB size while an array could take 4MB. Arrays are also easy to access for reading and writing.

2- The speed performance is also great. It performs faster computations than python lists.
3- Numpy support some specific scientific functions such as linear algebra. They help us in solving linear equations.
4- NumPy is very good for data analysis.

**DISADVANTAGES**

1- Using “nan” in Numpy: “Nan” stands for “not a number”. It was designed to address the problem of missing values. NumPy itself 
supports “nan” but lack of cross-platform support within Python makes it difficult for the user. That’s why we may face problems when comparing values within the Python interpreter.
2- Require a contiguous allocation of memory: Insertion and deletion operations become costly as data is stored in contiguous memory locations as shifting it requires shifting.

**APPLICATIONS**
->NumPy maintains minimal memory.
->Mathematical operations with NumPy like bitwise , linear algebra .
-> performing mathematical and logical operations on large high dimensional arrays and matrices.
-> Array Generation

**CONCLUSION**
NumPy is a python package used for numerical and scientific computing. It provides better runtime and space complexity. It provides a wide variety of array operations. 
If you wish to perform general-purpose operations, use python lists. But, if you care about performance and space complexity, use Numpy.
