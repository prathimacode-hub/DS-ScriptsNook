## **PROJECT TITLE**
Live Barcode and QR Code Reader

## **INTRODUCTION**
In this tutorial we will be performing a QR/Barcode scanner task which detects, scans and saves link in the `.txt` file. This task will be performed in the local enviornment.

## **PURPOSE**
I think QR/Barcodes are very cool and interesting because they store information in a different format. The fun part about them is we can’t really tell what they are storing until we scan them. **I did install all the required packages through `Git Bash` and edited the code the `visual Studio Code` and ran the `.py` file in `Git Bash` again.**

## **BRIEF EXPLANATION**
If you are wondering how barcode and QR code readers work, let’s do a quick real-life practice. Turn on your phone’s camera and show the featured image of this article. You will see a link show up, it’s very simple to use. Today, we will create our own reader, without losing any time let’s get started! 

## **WORKING CONDITIONS**
<ol>
    <li><strong>Setting up the enviornment</strong></li> </br>
     I recommend to perform the task in the local enviornment and not on the online enviornments because it might cause issues in loading your local camera. </br>

</br>
</br>
</div>
    <li><strong> Importing required Packages</strong></li> </br>
    Importing all the packages needed for the further processing of the model. </br>

</div> </br>
As i have already installed the packages, it is showing me like this.
</br>
</br>

</div>
    <li><strong>Decoding Function</strong></li> </br>

- Recognizing and decoding the barcode/QR code that we will be showing to the camera.
- Adding the stored information as a text on the recognized barcode/QR code.
- And lastly, exporting the stored information as a text document.  </br>

</div>
  </br>

</div>
    <li><strong>Main Function</strong></li> </br>
    In this step, we will write the main function, where the application is prompt to work. The main function will turn on the video camera of the computer, and the then call the decoding function. </br>

  </br>
  </br>
</div>
    <li><strong>Then Finally, Testing</strong></li> </br>
    </br>

- This is how the model detects and scans the QRcode/Barcode visible in the camera frame. </br>

- And this is how the model saves the result of the QRcode/Barcode scan in the `.txt` file 
</br>

## **USAGE**
The purpose of a barcode scanner is to scan or read a barcode symbol and then provide an electrical output to a computer via a decoder and cable. The decoder recognizes the type of barcode symbology it is seeing, translates the bar and space content and transmits data to a computer in a human readable format.

## **USE CASES**
- Advertising
- Events, travel, and movies
- Games
- Tracking food intake
- Tracking products

## **LIBRARIES USED**
- Pillow
- Numpy
- openCV
- pyzbar

## **ADVANTAGES**

- Barcodes Scanners Can Be Wireless.
- Human Error Can Be Prevented. 
- Barcode Scanners Are Efficient.
- Time Consumption Is Reduced.
- Real-Time Updates.

## **DISADVANTAGES**
- Physical Damages
- Label Damages
- Range 

## **APPLICATIONS**

- Business tracking.
- Library management. 
- Inventory control and management.
- Ticket verification.
- Tracking food intake.
- Gaming industry.

## **CONCLUSION**

Congrats!! You have created a program the reads barcodes and QR codes for you. Now, you have an idea of how to use computer vision and artificial intelligence in the real life. Working on hands-on programming projects like this one is the best way to sharpen your coding skills. I would be glad if you learned something new today.
